# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.2.3] - 2026-02-18
### Fixed
- **Consent dialog before login** — `AdMobProvider` was mounted outside the auth gate, causing the UMP consent dialog to appear on the login screen. Moved `AdMobProvider` inside the authenticated branch so it never mounts for unauthenticated users.
- **Thank-you alert fires immediately after login** — `AdConsentGate` mounted fresh after login but found `consentObtained=true` from the pre-login consent run and fired the alert instantly. Resolved by the same `AdMobProvider` relocation above.
- **Banner and interstitial ads never displaying** — Premature consent/loading race prevented ads from initialising. Fixed alongside the above; ads now initialise only after the user's tier is confirmed.
- **Ads race condition** — Added `setIsLoading(true)` at the start of `handleUser` in `RevenueCatContext` to keep `isLoading=true` for the entire async window while RevenueCat and Firebase resolve the user's tier.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-02-17
### Fixed
- `CustomAlert` background was semi-transparent; made it solid.
- Consent form re-triggered on every app foreground after first acceptance; added guard.
- Stale `showInterstitial` ref caused interstitial not to show.
- Ad shown on list completion even for premium users; added tier check.
- Empty-list guard missing before showing interstitial.
- App did not navigate back after list completion.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-02-16
### Fixed
- Urgent item Firebase sync failed with `permission-denied` — `createdAt` was a `Date` object; converted to `Number()` before writing.
- Supabase urgent item sync failed with `401 Invalid API key`.
- WatermelonDB observer did not fire when urgent item status changed from `active` to `resolved`; switched to broad query + JS filter.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-15
### Added
